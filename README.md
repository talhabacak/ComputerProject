# ComputerProject (Semi-Guided Data Annotation Tool)

- You can get information about the project from the report and article. The source codes was not shared as open source.

- In the project, It is the implementation of a semi-guided data labeling tool running on the windows operating system that provides manual labeling and autonomous labeling on YOLO models. Rectangular labeling can be done manually by the user; In autonomous labeling, any YOLO model can be imported or ready-made models in the application can be used. Ready models are based on YOLOv5s and YOLOv4-tiny trained with the COCO dataset. Pascal (xml) and YOLO(txt) can be imported and saved.
